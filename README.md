#Project 8 - NYC Data Map

![image](http://i.imgur.com/BGvcCjt.png)

##Scope
Students will produce a heatmap showing NYC 311 service request data. The objective of this project is to expose students to the Google maps API and to a "big data" exercise. Students will gain practice with using an API to retrieve data. They will learn how to draw gradients on a Google map.

#Before Class
Look at the starter code and solution code.

TODO: include starter and solution code

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Technical Vocabulary:**  
While completing this project the students will receive aid in the form of technical jargon.

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will work in teams to create the many programs.

**Version Control:**   
While completing this project the student will be using Github to store their programs.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will use review code from early programs to help write later programs.

**Search Engine Skills:**  
While completing this project the student will look in various libraries for reference to he program at hand.

**Command Line:**  
While completing this project the student may choose to run these programs in the terminal.

**Debugging**  
While completing this project the students will need to take earlier programs and debug them inorder to create a more challenging programming.

##Web Programming Skills
This project improves the student's web programming skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**API**  
While completing this project the students will use an API to retrieve data.

**Client server interaction**  
While completing this project the students will use an API to retrieve data from the server and then process it on the client side.

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class, they are given a short quiz about APIs.

##Opening
Introduce the concept of "big data". Show a big excel spreadsheet of data. Segue into data visualization. Draw an analogy to charts and graphs. Explain what a heatmap is and why they are used. Show an example of a heatmap.

##Lecture
* What is google maps? What problem does it solve?
* Talk about the google maps API. Run through a simple example of placing a marker.
* WHat is 311? Show 311 data: https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9?
* Talk about the available interface and how to talk to it. Run a sample request.

##Project Creation Time

* Break students into pairs.
* Do a wireframe
* Run sample requests and view responses.
* Start heatmap.

##Closing
* Talk about big data. Talk about the problem that it solves. Connect that to the project.

##Check for Understanding
* Give an exit-ticket quiz that tests for understand around big data, APIs, data visualization, etc.

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

##Homework
Instructor will assign homework based on progress in class.
